## Credit Card Approval Data Analysis


### Q1: What exploratory data analysis and preprocessing techniques are necessary to prepare the dataset for modeling?

- Use ProfileReport for EDA
- Visualize the customer status
- Create the dependent variable
- Merge the datasets
- Deal with missing values
- Change the days into years
- Adjust datatypes
- Apply encoding for categorical features
- Deal with imbalance dataset
- stardarize data
- Identify and handle outliers

### Q2: Which features are influential predictors for classifying credit card approval data?

- Apply filter method by f-value using feature extraction
- Summarize score and selected features
- Apply wrapper method by Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
- Use the extra trees forest method for feature selection analysis

### Q3: How does Logistic Regression perform for credit card approval classification compared to other techniques in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and stability?

- Train and test models with SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree
- Compare models using evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, f1, and auc
- Will work on tuning model by focusing on recall/f1/auc

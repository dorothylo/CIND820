Q1: What exploratory data analysis and preprocessing techniques are necessary to prepare the dataset for modeling? 
cell# 1 - 42 >> ProfileReport for EDA, visualize the customer status, create the dependent variable, merge the datasets, dealing with missling values, change the days into years, adjusting datatypes, apply encoding for categorical features, dealing with imbalance dataset, normalization, outliers 
Q2: Which features are influential predictors for classifying credit card approval data? 
cell# 43 - 55 >> apply filter method by chi-square using feature extraction, summarize score and selected features. apply wrapper method by Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) as well as using the extra trees forest method for feature selection analysis  
Q3: How does Logistic Regression perform for credit card approval classification compared to other techniques in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and stability?
cell# 59 - 77 >> modeling with training and testing set for SVM, random forest, Logistic Regression, Knn, and Decision Tree. Compared with different evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, f1, and auc.
